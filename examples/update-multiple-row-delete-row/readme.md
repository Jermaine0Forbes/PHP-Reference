# Update multiple rows and delete a row with ajax

## Date : 3/12/19

I wanted to learn how to update multiple rows with PHP because I never did that before
. And I also wanted to have the ability to delete the rows of a list of data at the same time

`index.php` - Has the form to insert data, list data, and the javascript to delete data
with ajax

`testing-db.php` - Creates an instance of mysqli

`ajax-delete.php` - Deletes a record based on the id that is passed to it
